4. **Manage**: Use the highlight manager to view, edit, and delete highlights

### 4. **Zoom Independence Testing**
Test that highlights maintain their position:

1. Create some highlights
2. Zoom in/out using the zoom controls
3. Verify highlights stay perfectly aligned with text
4. Try "Fit Width" and other zoom options

### 5. **Highlight Management**
